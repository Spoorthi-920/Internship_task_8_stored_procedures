# Task 8: Stored Procedures and Functions

## Objective
Learn how to modularize SQL logic using **Stored Procedures** and **Functions** for reusable and maintainable database operations.


## Overview
This task demonstrates the creation and execution of **stored procedures** and **user-defined functions** in **MySQL** using an *e-commerce* dataset (`customers` and `orders`).  
It focuses on implementing parameterized queries, conditional logic, and the use of `DELIMITER` to define reusable SQL blocks.


## Key Implementations
- **Stored Procedure:** `GetCustomerTotalSpent` – Calculates the total amount spent by a given customer.  
- **User-Defined Function:** `GetDiscount` – Returns the discounted value of an order based on a given percentage.  
- **Database Setup:** Created `customers` and `orders` tables with relational constraints.  
- **Logic:** Demonstrated parameter usage and modular query design.  
- **Best Practice:** Structured SQL scripts into setup, creation, and testing sections.


## Tools Used
- MySQL Workbench 
- SQL (DDL, DML, and procedural extensions)


## Outcome
Developed a clear understanding of how to:
- Write and execute stored procedures and functions  
- Use parameters and conditional logic effectively  
- Organize SQL scripts for better readability and reusability
